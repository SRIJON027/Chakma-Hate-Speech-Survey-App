Chakma Hate Speech Annotation Survey

This is a Streamlit web application designed to collect annotations for Chakma language hate speech detection. It allows native speakers to label comments as "Hate Speech" or "Non-Hate Speech" and identify mixed-language content.

🌟 Key Features

Batching System: Automatically divides 10,000 comments into batches of 50.

Concurrency Control: Ensures the same batch is not annotated by more than 3 distinct users.

Crash Handling: Progress is safe until submission; if a user disconnects, the batch resets for others.

Admin Panel: Separate login to track progress and download results without modifying data.

Google Sheets Integration: Real-time database storage.
